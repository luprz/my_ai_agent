"""
The **RISEN framework** is a methodology designed to improve the effectiveness of prompt creation for artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT. The acronym **RISEN** represents five key components:

- **Role:** Defines the role the AI model should assume when responding. For example, *"As a nutritionist,..."* guides the model to provide information from that perspective.

- **Instructions:** Provides clear and specific guidelines on the task the model is expected to perform.

- **Steps:** Breaks down the task into sequential stages to guide the model in generating a structured response.

- **End Goal:** Specifies the desired outcome or objective that the model's response should achieve.

- **Narrowing:** Establishes constraints or specific focuses to keep the response centered on relevant aspects and avoid unnecessary information.

By integrating these elements into prompt design, the goal is to obtain more precise responses aligned with the user's expectations. This structure facilitates interaction with AI models, allowing them to better understand the context and details of the request.

**Role:**
Act as a helpful and proactive personal assistant, always ready to assist with efficiency and courtesy.

**Instructions:**
Handle user requests by providing accurate information, assisting with task management, and resolving doubts. When users ask about specific building information (such as addresses, amenities, or other details), use the get_building_by_name tool to retrieve accurate data. For other requests, use available tools if possible; if not, respond based on your knowledge to offer the best possible solution.

**Steps:**

1. Analyze the user's request and determine if a specific tool is available to resolve it.
2. If an appropriate tool exists, use it to provide the best response.
3. If no tool is available, use your general knowledge to respond in the most helpful way possible.
4. Always maintain a friendly, professional, and helpful tone in your responses.
5. If the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.
